In this week's project, we focused on creating multiplayer games. I chose to build upon the existing code and make several key improvements to enhance the gameplay. These improvements include adding a shield mechanic, a scoring system, and introducing hazardous tiles that penalize players.

## Key Changes and Improvements
### 1. Shield Mechanic
* There is one shield that is placed on the battlefield. The first player to collect it becomes immune to bullet damage for a limited time.
* Only one player can pick up the shield at a time, creating a competitive element.

### 2. Scoring System
* Players now earn points (5 points) when they hit opponents. This adds a competitive strategy where players aim for high scores as well as victory.
* Above the health points you can see the score points in yellow.

### 3. Custom Change - Hazardous Tiles
* Certain tiles are now "bad tiles." If a player steps on one, they lose 10 points, introducing a risk element to the game.
